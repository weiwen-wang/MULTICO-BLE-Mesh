# MULTICO-BLE-Mesh


**Mesh knowledge**

This file contains the overview of BLE Mesh, Mesh Profile and Mesh Model

**Weiwen's Thesis**

This file contains the theis and presentation about my work.



For the sensor part:

In sensor code, the paper introduce the mathematical process and the coding is based on it. The microphone should be connected to the raspberry pi with USB interfacce. And the get_device_index.py can be used to get the index of microphone. This index will be used in the recording code.


Some reference of the BLE Mesh network:

Nordic Semiconductor SDK for Mesh:

In the Getting started, it shows how to install the tool,chain and building the stack.

I built the environment based in SEGGER Embedded Studio. You can also use CMake if you are familiar with the Linux.
